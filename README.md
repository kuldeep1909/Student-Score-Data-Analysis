# Student-Score-Data-Analysis
This Python project focuses on analyzing student data to gain insights into various aspects of education. We explore gender distributions, the impact of parents’ education, and the ethnic composition of students. Additionally, we’ve created visualizations to enhance understanding.

 To check the gender distributions of students:
- the impact of the parents education on their childerns education
- Distribution of EthnicGroup of the students
  
Also created some visulation for better understaing of the data like:
- Pie chart : to check the percentage distribution
- Heatmap : to figure out the relationships
- Countplot : to check the values according to the another dataset
- Boxplot : to detect the outliers in the data
